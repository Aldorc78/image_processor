# Infrastructure

In this folder you'll find the mechanisms to create the AWS infrastructure needed for this project.

_cloudformation_ folder shows how you would do it by using AWS Cluodformation service, whereas _terraform_ folder uses Hashicorp Terraform.

Always remember: _There's no perfect tool. It all depends on the context._
